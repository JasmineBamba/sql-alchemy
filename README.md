SQLAlchemy is an open-source SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python that bridges the differences among the various SQL dialects. A single Python script that uses SQLAlchemy can perform the same query across the different SQL dialects, such as:

## What is ORM?

ORM, which stands for Object-Relational Mapping, is a programming technique that allows you to work with a relational database using object-oriented programming concepts. In other words, it bridges the gap between the object-oriented model used in programming languages like Python, Java, or C# and the relational model used in databases like MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

In an ORM system, database tables are represented as classes, and rows in those tables are represented as objects. This enables developers to interact with the database using high-level programming constructs, such as classes and objects, rather than writing raw SQL queries.
